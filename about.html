    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Sheila Soh — an undergraduate <strong>Applied Computing (Fintech)</strong> student at the Singapore Institute of Technology, passionate about designing digital experiences that are both functional and meaningful. My work bridges the creative and the technical: from developing Java-based educational games and Flutter stock trading apps to designing accessible web platforms with Firebase and PHP.</p>
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience across <strong>financial systems</strong>, <strong>health tech</strong>, and <strong>public sector platforms</strong> through internships at <strong>Accenture</strong> and the <strong>Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)</strong>. These roles sharpened my ability to deliver UI/UX solutions, streamline backend processes, and align product features with real-world user needs.</p>
    <p>In both classroom and workplace settings, I apply design thinking, data-driven insight, and a love for clear communication. I’m also a former CCA leader — bringing strong organization, empathy, and collaboration into every team I join.</p>
